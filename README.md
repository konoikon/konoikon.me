# [My Personal Website](https://konoikon.me)

So, I decided I needed a personal website to kinda establish my self as a proper professional... My goals for this project is to write the whole website from the beginning without using shortcuts such as bootstrap and other tools that are used by most of the web developers nowadays (I don't think there's anything wrong with that, I just wanted to limit myself and enhance my core WebDev language knowledge)...

That's it for now... More TBA later.
